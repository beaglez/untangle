Description: *Untangle* is a Node.js app solving a very simple problem - to flatten an array of integers. I've chosen this simple problem to demonstrate what I consider to be the basic capability set of a good developer:

* 100% test coverage
* Self-documenting code
* DRY code
* Code organization
* Debug-ability
* Packaging and deployability
* Code management/Source control strategy
